**Technical Overview of the Project**

Our project is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that delivers a robust, map-integrated user interface, powered by a layered (N-Tier) architecture to separate concerns and improve scalability and maintainability. Built using a modern technology stack, the project combines a frontend interface for user interaction, a backend to handle business logic, and a data access layer that ensures secure and efficient data management.

### **Frontend**
- **Technology**: **TypeScript with React**
- **PWA Capabilities**: Developed with **PWA Builder**, the frontend is optimized for offline functionality, mobile responsiveness, and "Add to Home Screen" capabilities.
- **Mapping**: Users interact with their routes and geographical data through a seamless map interface powered by **MapBox** or **Google Maps API**.
- **UI/UX**: A responsive and intuitive user interface that enables users to access, view, and interact with data-rich routes, all rendered dynamically for performance and flexibility.

### **Backend**
- **Technology**: **Python with Flask**
- **Architecture**: **Layered (N-Tier) Architecture**, where the backend is designed to provide an API to the frontend and ensure clean separation of concerns.
  - **Presentation Layer**: Communicates with the frontend to process user inputs and serve the appropriate responses.
  - **Business Logic Layer**: Implements the project’s core suggestion algorithm, processing inputs and user-specific data to provide tailored route suggestions and insights.
  - **Data Access Layer**: Responsible for securely managing interactions with the **MySQL** database, retrieving and updating user data, routes, and other critical information.

### **Data Storage**
- **Database**: **MySQL**
  - **Data Management**: MySQL efficiently stores and retrieves user information, routes, and geographic data. This relational database is ideal for structured data storage, enabling complex queries and relationships crucial for our project’s routing and user information management.

### **Hosting**
- **Platform**: **AWS Lightsail**
  - **Deployment**: AWS Lightsail hosts the entire application stack, offering a scalable and cost-effective environment to manage the backend server and database while maintaining high availability.
  - **Security and Reliability**: Lightsail provides secure connections, SSL support, and options to scale up as the application’s demand grows.

### **Mapping API**
- **Service**: **MapBox or Google Maps API**
  - **Functionality**: Integrates mapping and geolocation capabilities within the frontend, allowing users to view, explore, and interact with custom routes and points of interest. These APIs enable real-time navigation, visualizations, and custom markers as needed.

### **Version Control and Collaboration**
- **Platform**: **GitHub**
  - **Source Control**: GitHub is used to manage version control, ensuring smooth collaboration among team members, tracking of changes, and streamlined workflows for development and deployment.

### **Additional Considerations**

This modular architecture and robust technology stack offer flexibility for future enhancements, such as integrating additional data sources, refining the suggestion algorithm, or implementing new features in response to user feedback.
